- There are different types of notes
  - The "concepts" folder is analgous to the "langauge" folder for a language tutorial
    - E.g. the "language" folder in the Bash tutorial
  - The "tasks" folder is analogous to the do-x-in-language/tool folder
    - E.g. the "package-management" folder in the Bash tutorial
  - The "tools" folder is analogous to the "executables" folder in a language tutorial
    - E.g. the "linux-executables" folder in the Bash tutorial
- These different types of notes _should_ have some overlap and _must_ be separate from one another
  - I always get confused when I start mixing these types of notes up together, as I'm doing now with these Splunk notes because there is so much to
    keep track of


- In a perfect world, "concepts" and "tools" would already be completed before "tasks" was started
